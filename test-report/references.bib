abstract = {In this article, a new model and a biomimetic pattern for heliostat field layout optimization are introduced. The model, described and validated herein, includes a detailed calculation of the annual average optical efficiency accounting for cosine losses, shading and blocking, aberration and atmospheric attenuation. The model is based on a discretization of the heliostats and can be viewed as ray tracing with a carefully selected distribution of rays. The prototype implementation is sufficiently fast to allow for field optimization. Parameters are introduced for the radially staggered layout and are optimized with the objective of maximizing the annual insolation weighted heliostat field efficiency. In addition, inspired by the spirals of the phyllotaxis disc pattern, a new biomimetic placement heuristic is described and evaluated, which generates layouts of both higher insolation-weighted efficiency and higher ground coverage than radially staggered designs. Specifically, this new heuristic is shown to improve the existing PS10 field by 0.36% points in efficiency while simultaneously reducing the land area by 15.8%. Moreover, the new pattern achieves a better trade-off between land area usage and efficiency, i.e., it can reduce the area requirement significantly for any desired efficiency. Finally, the improvement in area becomes more pronounced with an increased number of heliostats, when maximal efficiency is the objective. While minimizing the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is typically a more practical objective, results of the case study presented show that it is possible to both reduce the land area (i.e. footprint) of the plant and number of heliostats for fixed energy collected. By reducing the capital cost of the plant at no additional costs, the effect is a reduction in LCOE.}
